                Rules for analysis:
                * You must only choose [OBJECT] from the object list. 
                * You must show the physical properties of objects, their affordances, and their roles in completing the task.
                * You must reason about the relative positions of the objects along each axis. You must describe the spatial relationship between each pair of objects in the object list first based on numerical positions along each x, y and z axis. For example, whether the objects are in contact, and whether one object is on top of another object etc.

                Rules for [Abstract Plan]:
                * You must reason based on each object's properties and develop [Abstract Plan] with the highest confidence.
                * You must think about how to use [OBJECT] to finish the task.
                * You must think step by step and show the thinking process. For example, what objects you want to use, how to move them, in what order and cause what effect.
                * You must make ensure that the objects are in the right positions for you plan.
                * You must strictly adhere to the constraints provided in the numerical scene information.
                
                In the following, I will provide you the command and the scene information, and you will respond with the analysis. You must complete the task successfully using objects provided.

                You are a robot arm with a gripper as the end effector. The gripper is open initially.
                You are in a 3D world with x-axis pointing forward, y-axis pointing leftward, and z-axis pointing upward.
                You have a skill set containing the following skills:
                * 'move_to_position': Move the gripper to a position. It uses the goal-conditioned policy. You can use it to move to a target position. Moreover, you can use it with proper tools for manipulation tasks. You cannot rotate the gripper. You can only translate the gripper.
                * 'open_gripper': open the gripper before grasping an object.
                * 'close_gripper': close the gripper to grasp an object.
                * 'get_center': get the center position of an object.
                * 'get_graspable_point': get the graspable point of an object.

                Rules for detailed plan:
                * You must plan according to the analysis.
                * You must use existing skills.
                * You must make each plan step only call one skill at a time and be as atomic as possible.
                * You must not knock down any objects.
                * You must get the updated [OBJECT]'s position again if [OBJECT] has moved since the last 'get_center([OBJECT])'.
                * You must only query the object name provided in object list when using 'get_center' and 'get_graspable_point'.

                Individual rules with example answers for detailed plan:
                Rule: To use a grasped [OBJECT1] to move another [OBJECT2]: in the first step, you must make sure [OBJECT1]'s bounding box is adjacent to the [OBJECT2]'s bounding box to ensure that they are in contact. [OBJECT2]'s position does not change because of the contact. In the next step, you should move the grasped [OBJECT1] to push [OBJECT2].
                Example: 
                * Use the 'move_to_position' to move the grasped [OBJECT1] to make contact with [OBJECT2].
                * Use the 'move_to_position' to push the [OBJECT2] ...
                Rule: To push an [OBJECT] into the workspace, the xy position of [OBJECT] must be as close to [0.0, 0.0] as possible.
                Example:
                * Use the 'move_to_position' to push the [OBJECT] into the workspace.
                Rule: To grasp an [OBJECT], you must get the updated [OBJECT]'s graspable point first
                Example:
                * Use the 'get_graspable_point' to get the [OBJECT]'s graspable point.
                * Use the 'move_to_position' to move the gripper close to the graspable point before grasping it.
                * Use the 'close_gripper' to grasp the [OBJECT].

                Example answers for plan:
                <start of plan>
                * Use the [SKILL] to [SINGLE_TASK].

                Common Rules:
                * Calculate step by step and show the calculation process between <start of description> and <end of description>.
                * Return the 3D position between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
                * You must not assume any position and directly query the updated position of the objects.
                * You must calculate the target position along each dimension including x,y and z and calculate step by step.
                * The "get_position" and "get_size" do not need target positions. Return a space character between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
                * The 'push_to_position' skill takes the target object position and the object name as input, not the robot's target position.
                * The 'walk_to_position' skill takes the target 3D position as input. Note that the z position does not matter since the skill itself will handle the climbing. You can fill in 0 for the z position.
                * When calculating the target position for the 'push_to_position' skill, you must consider the spatial relationship between the objects. For instances, the target position of [OBJECT1] may be dependent on the position of [OBJECT2] and [OBJECT3].

                Example 1: 
                <Current Step>: Use the "push_to_position" to push 'box' to the middle of object_1 and object_2 in x-axis.
                <start of description>
                * The target position can be computed by using values obtained by "get_position" from the last step. 
                <end of description>
                <start of answer>
                The 3D target position is [(object_1_pos[0] + object_2_pos[0])/2, object_2_pos[1], object_2_pos[2]].
                <end of answer>

                Example 2: 
                <Current Step>: Use the "push_to_position" to push object_1 next to object_2.
                <start of description>
                * Since object_3 is occupying the adjacent positive x direction of object_2, we can only push object_1 to the negative x direction of the object_2. The target position along the x-axis is object_2_pos[0] - object_2_size[0]/2 - object_1_size[0]/2.
                <end of description>
                <start of answer>
                The 3D target position is [object_2_pos[0] - object_2_size[0]/2 - object_1_size[0]/2, object_2_pos[1], object_1_pos[2]].
